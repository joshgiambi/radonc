The average presentation is 40 yrs old. 99% are related to HPV transmission and exposure. Based on 2010 estimates, about 1 in 152 Canadian women is expected to develop cervical cancer during her lifetime and 1 in 475 will die from it.\r\n\r\n###### In Canada, it is estimated that in 2015\r\n\r\n- 1,500 Canadian women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer.\r\n- 380 women will die from cervical cancer in Canada.\r\n- Chances (probability) of developing or dying from cervical cancer\r\n\r\n###### Adenocarcinoma Rising Incidence\r\n\r\n- Adenocarcinoma is rising in incidence, especially in women younger than 35 years of age. \r\n- Part of the increase may be attributable to an increasing prevalence of HPV infection and part to improvements in screening and prevention of squamous intraepithelial neoplasia; thus leading to a histologic shift towards adenocarcinoma\r\n\r\n### Statistics\r\n\r\n- 3rd most common gynecologic cancer \r\n\r\n\r\n- 6th most common cancer in women\r\n- 40 years average age at presentation \r\n\r\n\r\n- 99% associated with HPV \r\n- Screening -> reduced mortality by 70%\r\n\r\n### Risk Factors\r\n\r\n###### Gynecologic\r\n\r\n1. Early onset sexual activity\r\n2. Large number of sexual partners \r\n3. STD's and high risk partners \r\n\r\n###### Behavioural\r\n\r\n1. Smoking \r\n2. Prolonged OCP use \r\n\r\n###### HPV Related\r\n\r\n- See Below\r\n\r\n## Human Papilloma Virus\r\n\r\nHPV Comprises 85% of cervical cancers. The most common subtypes include 16 and 18 which contribute to 70% of cervical cancers.\r\n\r\nHPV 16 and 18 have a high malignant potential, HPV 29, 31, 33 have low malignant potential and genital warts are generally caused by HPV 6 and 11. \r\n\r\n##### Subtypes\r\n\r\n- HPV 16 / 18 — high malignant potential\r\n- HPV 29, 31, 33 — low malignant potential\r\n- HPV 6, 11 — genital warts\r\n\r\n### Mechanism of Action\r\n\r\n###### <u>E6 downregulates P63</u>\r\n\r\n- **p53** functions as a negative regulator of cell growth, controling transit from G0/G1 to S Phase. It is a tumor supressor protein. \r\n- E6 binds to p53 promoting degredation causing an antiapoptotic effect, permitting the accumulation of chromosomal mutations without DNA repair\r\n\r\n###### <u>E7 binds to Retinoblastoma</u>\r\n\r\n- **Retinoblastoma** is a protien that inhibits the effect of positive growth regulation in response to DNA damage, it halts cell growth or induces cell apoptosis bind and render inactive the E2F transcription factor (E2F controls DNA synthesis and cyclin function and promotes the S phase of cell cycling)\r\n- E7 binds to Rb Via an E2F/Rb protein complex. E2F is released and allows cyclin A to promote cell cycling → permit cells with damaged DNA to bypass the G1 growth arrest. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Diagnosis\r\n\r\n## Pathology\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n### Subtypes\r\n\r\n##### **Sqamous Cell Carcinoma** — 20% of HPV cancers\r\n\r\n##### **Adenocarcinoma** — 80% of HPV Cancers\r\n\r\n##### **Rare** — Clear Cell Carcinoma\r\n\r\n### In Situ Disease\r\n\r\n##### ASCUS\r\n\r\n- Atypical squamous cells of unknown significant \r\n- 2/3 resolve spontaneously \r\n- Repeat PAP in 6 months and colposcopy if abnormal \r\n\r\n##### LGSIL\r\n\r\n- Low grade squamous lesion \r\n- Resolves spontaneously 40% of the time \r\n- Repeat PAP in 6 months and colposcopy if abnormal \r\n\r\n##### HGSIL\r\n\r\n- Highest grade squamous lesion \r\n- All should undergo colposcopy with biopsy \r\n- 30% resolve spontaneously \r\n- 22% progress to invasive lesions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Presentation\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n### Clinical Presentation\r\n\r\n##### Early Symptoms\r\n\r\n1. Abnormal vaginal bleeding\r\n2. Post-coital bleeding\r\n3. Abnormal vaginal discharge\r\n\r\n###### Late Symptoms\r\n\r\n- Triad of sciatic pain, lower extremity edema, hydronephrosis \r\n- Pelvic pain\r\n- Urinary or rectal symptoms \r\n- Fistulations \r\n\r\n### Investigation\r\n\r\n| Workup             | Imaging      | FIGO Imaging |\r\n| :----------------- | :----------- | :----------- |\r\n| Pelvic examination | CT Scanning  | Chest X-ray  |\r\n| US and biopsy      | MRI Scanning | Barium Enema |\r\n| Cystoscopy         | PET CT       | IV pyelogram |\r\n\r\n### Route of Spread\r\n\r\n##### Local Extension\r\n\r\n- Direct extension into parametria, ureterosacral ligament, vesicovaginal space, perirectal space, vagina \r\n- Ovarian spread is rare \r\n\r\n##### Regional Nodes\r\n\r\n- Stepwise progression alog lymph node echelons from pelvic to para-aortic nodes to thoracic duct to left supraclavicular nodes \r\n- Proximal metastasis in the absence of pelvic node involvement is uncommon \r\n\r\n##### Distant Metastasis\r\n\r\n- Distant mets are uncommon in the absence of extensive local or lymph node invovlement \r\n- Most common sites are: **lung, liver and bone**\r\n\r\n| Nodal Spread | Pelvic Nodes | PA Nodes |\r\n| :----------- | :----------- | :------: |\r\n| **Stage 1**  | 15%          |    5%    |\r\n| **Stage 2**  | 30%          |   20%    |\r\n| **Stage 3**  | 50%          |   30%    |\r\n\r\n### Management Pathway\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TFvUClQ.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Prognosis\r\n\r\n## Factors\r\n\r\n##### ![](https://i.imgur.com/F0hf5Jm.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Factors\r\n\r\n###### 1.

Primary RT results in similar outcome in these stages. For more advanced disease, RT alone (for stage IB1 tumors) and with concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy (for disease stages ≥ IB2 ) is the treatment of choice. Radical hysterectomy that has been performed in stage IIB tumors results in a greater incidence of urinary complications than does primary RT, and commonly in a need to add radiation with or without chemotherapy postoperatively because of adverse histologic findings. \r\n\r\n## Resectable\r\n\r\n#### Surgery or Radiotherapy?\r\n\r\n- Radical hysterectomy and primary RT result in equivalent tumor control and survival in stage IA–IIA disease. \r\n- Radical hysterectomy versus RT yielded no difference in disease-free (74%), overall-survival (83%), and local-recurrence (26 versus 25%) rates, but demonstrated a higher toxicity rate with surgery. \r\n\r\n###### Stage IA2: Stromal invasion up to 5.0mm with no LVSI\r\n\r\n- <u>Management</u>\r\n  - Hysterectomy\r\n  - Primary radiotherapy \r\n- <u>Outcomes</u>\r\n  - Survival > 95% \r\n  - Risk of nodal involvement is 5%\r\n  - Preservation of organ and ovarian function \r\n  - Avoid late radiation therapy morbidity \r\n- If LVSI \r\n  - Treat with Radical Hysterectomy\r\n\r\n###### IA2 with LVSI or non-bulky (<4 cm) IB2 - IIA\r\n\r\n- Management \r\n  - Radical Hysterectomy with PLND\r\n  - Primary Radiotherapy \r\n- Outcomes \r\n  - Survival of 80-90% after rad hyst \r\n  - 54% of patients with stage IB1 and 84% of patients with IB2 require post hysterectomy radiotherapy \r\n\r\n# Radiotherapy\r\n\r\n## Early Stage\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nRadiotherapy has the same efficacy for stage I-IIA as surgery. Definitve treatmentw ith CRT is given if > IIA disease. Concurrent \r\n\r\n### CRT\r\n\r\n#### Indications\r\n\r\n1. 5cm primary lesion \r\n2. Post hysterectomy RT \r\n3. Involved lymph nodes or surgical margins \r\n\r\n### Technique\r\n\r\n- EBRT to pelvis ± PA LN irradiation\r\n- Integrated with brachytherapy (BT)\r\n- Radiation therapy should be completed within 7 weeks\r\n\r\n### Adjuvant RT\r\n\r\nTwo randomized trials have defined the utility of adjuvant radiation, and adjuvant radiation with concurrent chemotherapy after hysterectomy.\r\n\r\n##### **GOG 92**\r\n\r\n- Clinical stage IB patients with lymphovascular space involvement (LVSI), large clinical tumor diameter, and more than a third of stromal invasion were randomized to post-hysterectomy pelvic RT versus no further treatment.\r\n- Recurrence rate was improved, but overall survival was not significantly different.\r\n\r\n##### ![](https://i.imgur.com/QI9EC2x.png)\r\n\r\nPostoperative pelvic radiation has been well established for involved LNs, parametria, or positive margins. The intergroup Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) Trial 109 evaluated whether the addition of concurrent che- motherapy is of benefit (Figure 22.6). Stage IA 2 , IB, or IIA patients treated with a radical hysterectomy and pelvic RT, were randomized to 4 cycles of cisplatin/5-FU versus RT without chemotherapy. Overall survival was signif- icantly improved. Post hoc analysis showed particular benefit for larger tu- mor sizes and/or multiple involved LNs (Source: Peters WA III, Liu PY, Bar- rett RJ II et al (2000) Concurrent chemotherapy and pelvic radiation ther- apy compared with pelvic radiation therapy alone as adjuvant therapy after radical surgery in high-risk early-stage cancer of the cervix.
